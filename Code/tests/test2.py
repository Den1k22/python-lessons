# Create variables "lenght" and assign number 10 to it


# Create for loop which works in range from 0 to "lenght"("lenght" excluded)
# Each loop should print loop! number


# Create for loop which works in range from 1 to "lenght"("lenght" included)
# Each loop should print loop! number


# set 0 to "lenght" variable


# Create while loop where each loop increases lenght by one, but before that it should print next messages:
# "Less than 5" if lenght is less than 5
# "Less than 10" if lenght is less than 10
# "Stop the loop" if lenght is 10 or more!


# create two variables:
# variable "number" and set 5 as Integer
# variable "text" and set "10" as String


# open file for writing with name "numbers.txt"


# write to file variables: "number" and "text"


# close file


# open file for reading with name "numbers.txt"


# read all text from file and print it
